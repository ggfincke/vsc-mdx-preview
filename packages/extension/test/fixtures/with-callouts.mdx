# Callout Test Document

This document tests GitHub-style blockquote alerts.

## All Alert Types

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note. Notes highlight information that users should take into account.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip. Tips are helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is important. Important information users need to know.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning. Warnings alert users to potential issues or gotchas.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution. Cautions advise about risks or negative outcomes.

## Multi-line Content

> [!NOTE]
> This alert has multiple lines of content.
> Each line should be preserved in the output.

## Regular Blockquotes

Regular blockquotes without the alert syntax should render normally:

> This is a regular blockquote.
> It should not be transformed into an alert.

## Case Insensitivity

These should all work:

> [!note]
> Lowercase note

> [!Note]
> Mixed case note

> [!NOTE]
> Uppercase note
